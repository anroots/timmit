# TIMMIT v1.0

The Tried Intelligent Methods Met Impossible Trolls Waiver (TIMMIT) is a piece of semi-serious, but **not legally binding** humor.

Include this file in your software project to lighten your conscience when you're forced to write low quality, untested code.

# Usage

Include the `WAIVER.md` file in your project root directory.

If the project is publicly accessible from the web, consider adding a server exception so that the file could not be reached via direct HTTP.

Do not use this if it is within your power to make things better but you're just lazy or unwilling to learn.

## Use cases

Use this when...

* The [Project Management Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) get blatantly ignored either by the client and/or the manager at project inception or during a sprint
* You're taking over maintenence / development of a codebase that is a mess
