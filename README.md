# TIMMIT v1.0

The Tried Intelligent Methods Met Impossible Trolls Waiver (TIMMIT) is a piece of semi-serious, but **not legally binding** humor.

Include this file in your software project to lighten your conscience when you're forced (due to external limitations and/or influences) to write bad code.

# Usage

Include the WAIVER.md file in your project root directory. If the project is publicly accessible from the web, consider adding a server exception so that the file could not be reached via direct HTTP.

# Contribute

Modify the waiver text as you see fit (fix typos, add sections / clauses) and send a pull request.
